## 1. Time on Windows Slower than Linux  
If the time on Windows is slower than Linux, run the following command to configure Windows to treat the hardware clock as UTC (just like Linux does):  

```bash  
reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\TimeZoneInformation" /v RealTimeIsUniversal /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f  
```  

## 2. Error: "The drive or UNC share you selected does not exist or is not accessible. Please select another"  
If you encounter this error while installing an application:  

1. Open **Control Panel**.  
2. Navigate to **Programs** -> **Programs and Features**.  
3. Locate the old version of the application that was not fully removed.  
4. Delete the old version.
